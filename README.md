# Deep-Learning-Python-codes
Here, I put my Deep learning related python codes: (This section is under construction! I am working on updating this documentry.)

<b>*CNN_malaria_cells_images_project.ipynb:</b>

Detecting if cells are infected by Malaria or not based on a Convolutional Neural Netwok. The dataset can be downloaded from the <a href="https://lhncbc.nlm.nih.gov/publication/pub9932">National Library of Medicine</a>. In addition, since it takes quite a long time for the model to be fit, I used a pre-defined trained file named "malaria_detector.h5" that I have also uploaded here.

<b>*02-Autoencoder-Exercise_UK foods.ipynb:</b>

The dataset is "UK_foods.csv", and this code detects a country in the Uk that their food and meals are more distictive than the rest.
