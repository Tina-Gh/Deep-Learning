# Deep-Learning-Python-codes
Here, I put my Deep learning related python codes: (This section is under construction! I am working on updating this documentry.)

<b>*CNN_malaria_cells_images_project.ipynb:</b>

Detecting if cells are infected by Malaria or not based on a Convolutional Neural Netwok. The dataset can be downloaded from the <a href="https://lhncbc.nlm.nih.gov/publication/pub9932">National Library of Medicine</a>. In addition, since it takes quite a long time for the model to be fit, I used a pre-defined trained file named "malaria_detector.h5" that I have also uploaded here.

<b>*02-Autoencoder-Exercise_UK foods.ipynb:</b>

The dataset is "UK_foods.csv", and this code detects a country in the Uk that their food and meals are more distictive than the rest.

<b>*02-RNN-Exercise_Ice cream and frozen dessert dataset.ipynb:</b>

The dataset can be found from <a href="https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/IPN31152N">Industrial Production: Nondurable Goods: Ice cream and frozen dessert</a>

<strong>* 10_RNN_google stock dataset_Regression:</strong>

The dataset is "Google_Stock_Price_Train.csv" and "Google_Stock_Price_Test.csv". In this code I built a model using RNN to predict the Google's stock prices for January 2017, given the dataset from 2012 to 2016. The model could well follow the upward and the downward trends.
